## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Bay Area Bike Share Trips Data available at: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data&sa=D&ust=1554486256012000
San Francisco offers bike ride services as a way for commuters / visitors to travel through the congested city lanes. Details include trip information such as duration, start and end stations, subscriber type, etc.
There are 11070 bikes in this dataset with 2,506,983 rows and 15 features (duration_sec, start time, end time, start station id, start station name,start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude,end station id, end station name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, bike share for all trip, rental access method).


## Summary of Findings

> Regardless of user type, the morning (7am-9am) always had the largest peak. This suggests it would be worth FordGoBike's time to always monitor Market St at 10th St during this time. The evening also had a peak but it was greater for subscribers than for customers. Subscribers also make up a larger demographic of users so FordGoBike may benefit from looking more into stations and times frequented by subscribers over customers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> When it comes to desicion making, FordGoBike company should consider monitoring and some certain stations over others and decide whether supporting customer or subscribers is more important.
